# Leo Wang
## Summary:
--------------------------------------------------------------
I'm a fastidious programmer who cares about not only the correctness but also the beauty of my code.

I'm a tenacious and open minded trouble-shooter. I always come out with solutions and closures. My colleagues are prone to turn to me when they have "weird" bugs.

I'm an efficient continuous learner. I embrace new techniques and methodologies. I'm versatile in various programming languages, different protocols and lots of platforms.

I'm a part-time trainer in Alcatel-Lucent University teaching Linux and Perl programming. I believe that teaching is the best way to mastery.

I'm a self-starter who founded the Toastmasters Club in our R&D community to help myself and my colleagues on public speaking and communication skills. We all have benefited from the philosophy of learn by doing in this club.

I'm confident about my crafts and willing to contribute to the team.
